### Riff
Scribbletune can be used to generate a commonly used pattern for riffs in trance music.

There is a commonly used technique to create riffs. You video randomly click some of the steps in a 16 beat pattern and moves them around while sticking to a particular scale. Then, on a lower octave, add notes to the missing steps on a particular key to act as the counter point notes. This works great and quickly creates a nice little riff.

You can do the same with Scribbletune. You can even create a JavaScript function that does this and allow it to access some things such as "key", "scale" and "chord degrees" to use as the progression.

Here's a sample of what we are gonna end up creating in a dynamic sort of way using Scribbletune.
